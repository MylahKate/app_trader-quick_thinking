SELECT 'google' as store,
name, rating, price::text, review_count, primary_genre
FROM app_store_apps

UNION ALL 

SELECT 'apple' as store, name, rating, price, review_count::text, genres
FROM play_store_apps
WHERE rating IS NOT null
ORDER by name


This doesn't work for wanting to focus on apps in both stores
